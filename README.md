# Kitchen App


“Kitchen App” is an organizing tool for shared kitchens. I am living in a dorm, where we share a kitchen with up to 20 people. Many of the kitchens struggle with organizing the shared space over Facebook groups. Cleaning schedules, tasks or monthly payments notifications get overlooked in the Facebook groups due to newer posts and other information. Besides that, the kitchen admins have to use several additional tools to organize tasks, schedule cleaning, keep track of payments and expenses etc. 

Hence my project is an attempt to provide shared kitchen spaces with tools to solve the problem. The tools are in regards to organizing finances, distributing tasks, organizing events and communication within the group. 

Each kitchen can create a room for their kitchen in the app. The room has (multiple) admins and members. 

 A member of the room can see an overview of all their assigned tasks, mark their tasks as done, view their completed tasks, view all unassigned tasks and voluntarily pick up a task, add tasks/things to purchase, create/view events, use the notes section (post, comment, like a post or comment), see all the members of the room and chat with each of them, update their profile info, request money back for purchases, find general information regarding the kitchen such as rules, mobile pay box etc.

An admin can view the room in “view mode”, which is how a normal member views the room. However the admin can also change to “edit mode”. In the edit mode it is possible for the admin to update/remove almost all the information displayed to a member. The admin can remove assigned/unassigned tasks, assign tasks to a specific member f.e. monthly payments, view all current assigned and completed tasks, create a weekly cleaning schedule, which assigns a week of cleaning to a member, create subtasks for the weekly cleaning, which need to be done by a member before the weekly cleaning task will be considered as done, add a member to a group, remove a member, make another member admin, look up users to add to a room, update information such as kitchen fund, rules, group image etc., can remove information such as events, posts, comments etc.
